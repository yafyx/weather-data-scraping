# Weather Data Scraper

## Overview

The Weather Data Scraper is a Python script designed to extract historical weather data from the Time and Date website for a specific location. The script utilizes web scraping techniques to gather information from the historical weather tables and organizes the data into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features

- Extracts historical weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, barometric pressure, and visibility.
- Supports multiple date options for historical weather data.
- Outputs the collected data to a CSV file for easy integration into other applications or analysis tools.

## Usage

To use the Weather Data Scraper, follow these steps:

1. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. Copy and paste the provided script into a Python file (e.g., `weather_scraper.py`).

3. Replace the URL in the `get_weather_data` function call with the desired Time and Date historical weather URL.

   ```python
   with get_weather_data("YOUR_TIME_AND_DATE_URL_HERE") as weather:
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python weather_scraper.py
   ```

   The script will generate a CSV file named `weather_data.csv` in the same directory as the script.
